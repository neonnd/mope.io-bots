### Installation

1. Download [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run the file called `install.bat`. 
3. If you are on chrome install tampermonkey extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), and if you are on firefox download the tampermonkey extension from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

### Activating Bots

First we will need to turn our server on so that our client script can interact with the server and receive bots.

1. Run the file called `run.bat`
2. Copy the code from [client.js](https://github.com/Neonx99/mope.io-bots/blob/master/client.js) and make a new script on tampermonkey.
3. Go to [mope.io](https://mope.io/) and enjoy!
